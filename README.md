### Python Projects Collection:
This repository contains a few small but useful Python projects that I built to improve my programming skills. Each project is self-contained, beginner-friendly, and focuses on learning by building real-world tools using Python.

### 1.Translator (translator.py)
A GUI-based language translator built using `tkinter` and a translation API like `googletrans`. The user can enter text, choose source and target languages, and instantly translate the text.
**What I learned:**  
- GUI development with `tkinter`  
- Using external libraries for translation  
- Handling user input and dropdown selections
  
### 2. Password Generator (passwordgenerator.py)
A simple tool to generate strong, random passwords. Users can choose the length of the password and generate a secure combination of characters.
**What I learned:**  
- Using Python's `random` and `string` libraries  
- Working with GUI elements  
- String manipulation and user input  

### 3. Attendance System (attendance_system.py)
An attendance tracker using Python and `OpenCV`. It detects faces via webcam and marks attendance in a CSV file, with timestamps.

**What I learned:** 
- Face detection using `OpenCV`  
- Real-time video processing  
- CSV file handling  
- Basic automation
